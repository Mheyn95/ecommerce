## Usage

To use this application go to the directory where you cloned the repository in the terminal. Once here you can login to mysql by typing "mysql -u {username} -p" and then entering your password, then type "source db/schema.sql", which will create the database for the application. You can then quit out of mysql by entering "quit" and enter. Then type, "npm run seed", in the terminal to populate the database with tables and data. Once that completes you can start the server with "node server.js", the application will then run and establish a connection to the database.

Here you can see the different commands to setup and run the application.
